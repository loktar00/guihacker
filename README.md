Gui Hacker
=========

Ridiculous output to make you look like an amazing hacker.

Created as a joke for this question on [Code Golf SE](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/30322/make-it-look-like-im-working)

Added some limited options for customizability

* title - change the title to whatever
* color - give it a css color string and the script will use that color
* gui - true/false to hide or display the 3d thing, and bars.

You can pass the options to the url via the location hash like so

```http://guihacker.com/#{"title":"sometitle", "color" : "red", "gui":false}```
